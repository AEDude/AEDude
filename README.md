Profile Picture: Current WIP Animation Sequence

Being passionate about creating engaging and immersive experiences that transport players to new worlds empowers me with 
the opportunity to enable players with the chance of connecting with the characters they're experiencing on a deeper level. 
My skillsets mainly focus on developing 3D animations, rigging characters and vehicles and also developing games via animation 
programming in Unreal Engine 5 using modern C++. In result of the absolute latter I have found a new love and interest in 
understanding math on a deeper level. I believe having a concrete foundation in the understanding of math is essential to 
achieve a positive return in gameplay design. 

When I'm not locked into 3D art, I enjoy playing action video games, training my body in martial arts, skateboarding, working 
out at the gym or outside (calisthenics), watching anime/ reading manga and racing motorcycles! These activities help me bring 
fresh perspectives and creativity to my work.
